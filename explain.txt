subtask 3: 
after we created the daemon thread we ran it in one terminal and opened another terminal and in that terminal we wrote the command cat /var/log/syslog and we saw that our daemon thread worked.
in the last few lines in the syslog the daemon wrote the lines we we wrote in the code
(grep didnt work for some reason)

subtask 4:
we did the same thing as in subtask 2
we cloned the our program 3 times using  the clone call and for each clone we ran a diffrent function that runs one of the main tasks
